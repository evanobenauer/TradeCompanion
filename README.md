# Trade Companion

![title](img/tctitle.gif)

TradeCompanion is an *OLD and VERY MESSY* project of mine from college. I was experimenting with displaying and calculating stock data... for fun ya know...

Do not expect any code in here to be clean. BUT, some of the tools I have coded during this process were incredibly well written. Their legacy will live on in my new repository *Trade Scavenger*


Items included in this repository: 
- Indicator Builders
- Historical Indicator Calculators
- Full chart navigation with visible indicators
